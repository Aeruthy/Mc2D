A Love2D Extension | Library For Making Games With Minecraft's Commands Syntax With Lua!

# Conclusions
"Why Use Mc2D?", "Cant You Just use the Normal LÖVE2D Features to Make Games?".
Well, There's no Reason in Your Decision On what You Will use Mc2D or Not.
Mc2D is Just a Library/Extension For LÖVE2D to Simplify Entity Management, Collisions, And Some More Stuffs.
However, Mc2D is Not Intended for Real Games. Mc2D is Just for Prototyping Your Games in A Fast-Pace,
But if You are Willing to Make games Using Mc2D Entirely with LÖVE2D, Then It's Your Decision.
